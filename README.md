# What is this?
This is a helper for slash commands creation and management when
using Discord API.

# How to use it?
It's still under development, so you cannot do much with it yet.
My objetives are to develop a user friendly interface to create or
edit slash commands easier without having to deal with JSON.

# Does it store my token?
The token is only used when sending request to the Discord API.
You can review the source code if you want, no information is stored
or sent to external sites.
